                        <li>In some cases you have the right to request erasure of your personal data without ungrounded delay. These hypotheses arise when: your personal data is not needed any more with regard to the purposes for which the data has been collected or processed; you withdraw your consent   
                        for processing made on the basis of consent; you object against the processing in accordance with certain rights of the applicable legislation for protection of the personal data; the processing is for the purposes of the direct marketing; your personal data were illegally processed. Restriction of the right to erase personal data is present when the processing of these personal data is needed for exercising of the right of freedom of expression and information; for observing of obligation arisen by virtue of a normative act; or for instituting, prosecution or defense of/against legal claims.</li> 

                        <li>You have the right to require restriction of the processing of your personal data in some of the following cases:

                                        <li>the precision of the personal data is disputed by you, for a term which allows the administrator to verify the accuracy of your personal data;</li>     
                                       
                                        <li>the processing is unlawful, but you don't want your personal data to be deleted but instead require its use to be restricted;</li>     
                                       
                                        <li>the administrator does not need any more your personal data for the purposes of processing, but you require their processing for instituting, prosecution or defense of legal claims;</li>     
                                       
                                        <li>you have objected against the processing waiting for examination whether the legal grounds on which we process your personal data have priority over your interests;</li>

                                <li>When the processing is restricted due to one of the hypotheses quoted above, such data will be processed, with exception of its storage, only with your consent or with the purpose of instituting, prosecution or defense of legal claims, protection of the rights of another physical person or due to important grounds of public interest for the European Union or a Member State.</li>    
                                
                                <li>When you have requested restriction of the processing pursuant to paragraph 1, we shall inform you before the revoking of the restriction of the processing.</li>    
                            </ol>

                        <li>You have the right at any time and on grounds related to your specific situation, to object to processing of your personal data when a processing is performed on one of the following grounds:

                                <li>the processing is needed to execute a task of public interest or at the exercising of official powers which have been granted to us;</li>    
                                
                                <li>the processing is needed for the purposes of our legitimate interests or of a third party, except when priority over such interests has the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of the personal data, more specifically when the data subject is a child.</li>
                            </ul>   
                        </li>
                       
                        <li>In case you have explicitly given your consent for processing of your personal data for the purposes of direct marketing (including profiling for the purposes of the direct marketing), you have the right to object against such processing at any time. In case you make such an objection we will discontinue the processing of your personal data to that effect. We will discontinue the processing of your personal data, except when we find out that there are convincing legal grounds for the processing which have priority over the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for instituting, prosecution or defense of legal claims.</li>
                            
                        <li>We will process your personal data for historical scientific purposes or for statistical purposes only if such processing is needed to execute a task performed by considerations for public interest.</li>

                        <li>Insofar the legal ground for the processing of your personal data is:    
                            <ul>
                                <li>a consent; or</li>    
                                
                                <li>the processing is necessary for the execution of a contract you are a party to or have undertaken steps to conclude a contract upon your request, and this processing is performed in automated ways,</li>  
                            </ul>
                        </li>  

                        <p>You have the right to request personal data from us in a structured, accessible and machinereadable format. A restriction of this right shall be present when the transfer of the data will affect unfavorably the rights and freedoms of third persons. The same will be valid when your personal data are transferred to another administrator (Right of transfer of data).</p> 
                            
                        <li>In case you consider that the processing of your personal information is in violation of the laws on data protection, you have the right to file a complaint with a supervisory body responsible for the data protection. You may do this in the Member State of EU where you usually reside, are employed or at the place of the presumed violation.</li>
                            
                        <li>Insofar the legal ground for the processing of your personal information is consent, you will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time. The withdrawal will not affect the conformity with the law of the processing before the withdrawal as well as it will not affect or restrict the processing of any other legal ground or contract.</li>

                        <li>You may exercise your rights with a view to your personal data by written notification to us and to send it to our official contact email address published on our website.</li>

                        <li>We will keep some of your data in order to enable subsequent personal identification, in order to avoid abuse, for rectifying problems, in order to assist to any investigations, in order to apply our General provisions and/or to observe legal requirements for storage of personal data. Therefore, you should not expect that all your personal identifying information will be completely removed from our database in response to your request. We also keep history of the changes made to the granted data, in order to investigate presumed frauds with your profile.</li>

                        <li>We strive to guarantee that the services we provide to our clients are of possibly the highest standard. With a view to that purpose, sometimes it may become necessary to record the telephonic and electronic messages between our employees and third persons in order to assure the quality and training or if it is permitted by the law only after you have been notified of that. We will always perform monitoring of the communications with accordance to the applicable legislation and at any time will continue to protect the privacy of your messages in accordance with these rules.</li>

                        <p class="font-AeonikBold">International transfers of personal data (including to providers of services assigned to external subcontractors)</p>    
                       
                        <li>It may become necessary to transfer your personal information to business partners and services providers residing in territories outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). For instance, we may maintain the MyMonty App and the Paynetics card and the services related to it from centres such as USA and we may process payments via other organisations like card networks and payment schemes located outside EEA. Upon downloading and usage of MyMonty App, of Paynetics card you explicitly agree to that. You should bear in mind that we will never transfer your personal data to a state or to an organisation which does not offer sufficient level of protection, without your explicit informed consent. The protection provided by General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) follows the data provided by you which means that the rules for personal data protection continue to be applied regardless of the place where the data is located. This is valid also when the data is transferred to a state which is not member of EU (hereinafter referred to “third country”). Here are the cases which the General regulation envisages for authorized transfer of personal data:    
                            <ul>
                                <li>Sometimes by decision of the European Commission may be declared that a third country offers adequate level of protection (“decision for adequate level of protection“) which means that we may transfer data to other company in that third country without submitting additional guaranties or the data becoming subject of additional conditions. In other words,  the transfers to a third country with adequate level of protection will be comparable to the transfer of data within EU;</li>

                                <li>In case of absence of a decision for adequate level of protection the transfer may be made via providing appropriate guaranties and under condition that applicable rights are present  and effective legal means of protection of the physical person. These appropriate safeguards include, among others:</li>    
                                
                                <li>In the case of a group of enterprises or groups of companies performing joint economic activity, the companies may transfer personal data on the basis of the so-called bonding corporate rules;</li>    
                                
                                <li>Contract agreement with the recipient of the personal data, by using for instance the standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission;</li>    
                                
                                <li>Observing of a Code of conduct or mechanism for certification, together with obtaining of bonding and executable commitments from the recipient for enforcing of appropriate safeguards for protection of the transferred data; and finally, if it is envisaged to transfer personal data to a third country which is not a subject to a decision for adequate level of protection, and if appropriate safeguards are missing, there may be made a transfer on the basis of a number of exceptions for specific situations, for instance when a person has agreed explicitly with the suggested transfer, after being provided with all necessary information regarding the risks related to the transfer.</li>    
                            </ul>
