                    <p>First party cookies hosted on the website you are visiting. They are only set or retrieved by the website while you are visiting it, so they cannot normally be used to track activity or pass data from one site to another.

Sometimes these scripts will also bring additional functionality to the site, such as enabling content to be shared via social networks.</p>
                    <p>Online advertising is the most common use of third party cookies. By adding their tags to a page, which may or may not display adverts, advertisers can track a user (or their device) across many of the websites they visit.</p>
