                    <h2 class="font-AeonikBold text-lg md:text-xl xl:text-2xl 4xl:text-4xl mt-2">First Party Cookies</h2>
                    
                    <p>First party cookies hosted on the website you are visiting. They are only set or retrieved by the website while you are visiting it, so they cannot normally be used to track activity or pass data from one site to another. However, the owner of that website can still collect data through their cookies and use that to change how the website appears to the user, or the information it displays.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="font-AeonikBold text-lg md:text-xl xl:text-2xl 4xl:text-4xl mt-2">Third Party Cookies</h2>
                    
                    <p>Third party cookies are where the host domain or address is not the same as the website you are visiting. They are usually placed in a website via scripts or tags added into the web page. Sometimes these scripts will also bring additional functionality to the site, such as enabling content to be shared via social networks.</p>
                    
                    <p>Online advertising is the most common use of third party cookies. By adding their tags to a page, which may or may not display adverts, advertisers can track a user (or their device) across many of the websites they visit.</p>
